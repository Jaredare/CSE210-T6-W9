0.001: Created the repo.

0.002: Made the changelog and plan files.

0.003: Put the snake game in the folder for reference.

0.004: Added a list of things we need to do to the plan, copied the game out of the snake file for use and editing.

0.005: Started making the second snake. Removed most/all things to do with food, 
        and coded what was supposed to be a second snake as seen in __main__.py line 29 and 
        control_actors_actions.py lines 34-37 and 58-75.

0.006: Added visualization for the second cycle. 

0.007: Added differing colors for both cycles. Worked on adding collision for the cycles. May or may not work.

0.008: Fixed an issue in the positioning of the cycles and the way that constants.py was being handled. 

0.009: Added proper collision and cycle growth. Cycle growth needs refining, but functionality exists. 

0.010: We tried our absolute best to make the scores. The position refuses to work, and I don't know why. We've been on this for two hours. Just look at it please, we're both tired. 

0.011: Got the position of the score to work by changing score.set_position to self.set_position in score.py, 
        and changed the locations of the scores to be in the top left and top right corners.

0.012: Removed constants.py from the main part of the program. We had moved it into shared several versions back, but had never removed the original version.

0.013: Added logic to handle_growth_action.py to limit cycle growth based on whether the game had ended or not.

0.014: Added comments to a number of things, edited a few comments and updated plan.txt

0.015: Removed the old snake game that was renamed to "KEEP CLOSED"
