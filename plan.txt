How Snake works:
    



Things we need to do:
    To change our Cycle game from Snake into a Cycle game: 
        We'll need a second snake.
            We'll need the second snake to have different keys associated with moving.
            We'll need to change the colors of the snakes.
        We'll need to make the snakes grow according to time or distance rather than by collecting fruit.
        We'll need to make sure that a player can die to their opponent's tail.
        Game over is already incorporated. The base snake turns white.

        We currently have 18/16 classes.
